# Data War - Test Scenarios Reference

This document provides comprehensive test scenarios for all game mechanics and special effect cards. Use this as a reference when writing tests for the game store, state machine, and UI components.

Each scenario includes the specific `initializeGame()` call needed to set up the test conditions.

## Available Deck Order Strategies

```typescript
type DeckOrderStrategy =
  | 'random'              // Standard Fisher-Yates shuffle
  | 'tracker-first'       // Tracker cards at top of deck
  | 'firewall-first'      // Firewall cards at top
  | 'move-first'          // Move cards at top
  | 'blocker-first'       // Blocker cards at top
  | 'launch-stack-first'  // Launch stack cards at top
  | 'special-first'       // All special cards at top
  | 'common-first'        // Common cards at top
  | 'high-value-first'    // Sort by value (5→1)
  | 'low-value-first'     // Sort by value (1→5)
  | 'owyw-first'          // OWYW cards at top
  | 'custom';             // Custom ordering with typeIds array

// Usage:
initializeGame(playerStrategy?, cpuStrategy?, playerCustomOrder?, cpuCustomOrder?)
```

#### Scenario: CPU wins with higher value
- **Init**: `initializeGame('low-value-first', 'high-value-first')`
- **Setup**: Player plays Common-2 (value 2), CPU plays Common-4 (value 4)
- **Expected**: `resolveTurn()` returns `'cpu'`
- **Expected**: CPU collects both cards after effects processing

#### Scenario: Tie triggers Data War
- **Init**: `initializeGame()` (random, then manually set equal values)
- **Setup**: Player plays Common-4 (value 4), CPU plays Common-4 (value 4)
- **Expected**: `resolveTurn()` returns `'tie'`
- **Expected**: `checkForDataWar()` returns `true`
- **Expected**: State machine transitions to `data_war` state

#### Scenario: Cards collected only after effects processing
- **Init**: `initializeGame('high-value-first')`
- **Setup**: Player plays Common-5, CPU plays Common-3
- **Expected**: After `resolveTurn()`, cards remain in `cardsInPlay`
- **Expected**: After `processPendingEffects()` and `collectCardsAfterEffects()`, cards are transferred to winner's deck

### Card Play

#### Scenario: Play card from top of deck
- **Init**: `initializeGame()`
- **Setup**: Player has 33 cards in deck
- **Action**: `playCard('player')`
- **Expected**:
  - `player.playedCard` is the top card
  - `player.deck` has 32 cards
  - Card is added to `cardsInPlay`
  - `player.currentTurnValue` equals card value

#### Scenario: Empty deck protection
- **Init**: Not needed (manually set empty deck)
- **Setup**: Player has 0 cards in deck
- **Action**: `playCard('player')`
- **Expected**: No crash, logs error in development mode

#### Scenario: Normal mode sets value
- **Init**: `initializeGame('common-first')`
- **Setup**: `anotherPlayMode = false`, player has 5 cards
- **Action**: `playCard('player')` with Common-3 (value 3)
- **Expected**: `player.currentTurnValue = 3` (replaces previous value)

#### Scenario: Another play mode adds value
- **Init**: `initializeGame('tracker-first', 'common-first')`

- **Setup**: Player plays Blocker-2, CPU plays Blocker-1
- **Expected**:
  - Player's opponent (CPU) reduced (but blocker has 0 value, so net = 0)
  - CPU's opponent (player) reduced (but blocker has 0 value, so net = 0)
  - Both play second cards
  - Values compared based on second cards

## Data Grab

**Card Count**: 3 cards
**Card Value**: 0
**Effect Type**: Queued
**Effect**: Randomly distribute all cards in play between both players

### Core Functionality

#### Scenario: Basic data grab distribution
- **Init**: `initializeGame('custom', 'special-first', ['data-grab', 'common-5', 'common-4'])`
- **Setup**: 8 cards in play (4 common + special effects), player plays Data Grab and wins
- **Action**: `processPendingEffects('player')` called
- **Expected**:
  - All cards in `cardsInPlay` shuffled randomly
  - Cards split alternating: even indices to player, odd to CPU (or vice versa)
  - `cardsInPlay = []` after distribution
  - Both players receive roughly equal cards

#### Scenario: Odd number of cards
- **Init**: `initializeGame('custom', 'common-first', ['data-grab', 'common-3', 'common-2'])`
- **Setup**: 5 cards in play, Data Grab played
- **Expected**:
  - One player gets 3 cards, other gets 2
  - Distribution is random

#### Scenario: Data Grab with 2 cards
- **Init**: `initializeGame('custom', 'custom', ['data-grab'], ['common-3'])`
- **Setup**: Only 2 cards in play, Data Grab played
- **Expected**:
  - Each player gets 1 card
  - No winner takes all

#### Scenario: Data Grab doesn't care about winner
- **Init**: `initializeGame('custom', 'high-value-first', ['data-grab', 'common-2'])`
- **Setup**: Player plays Data Grab and loses turn
- **Expected**: Data Grab still distributes cards randomly (no winner condition)

#### Scenario: Multiple Data Grabs in turn
- **Init**: `initializeGame('custom', 'custom', ['data-grab'], ['data-grab'])`
- **Setup**: Both players play Data Grab
- **Expected**:
  - Both effects processed in order
  - First Data Grab distributes cards
  - Second Data Grab has no cards to distribute (already distributed)
